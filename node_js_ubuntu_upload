Node.js Deployment
Steps to deploy a Node.js app to DigitalOcean using PM2, NGINX as a reverse proxy and an SSL from LetsEncrypt

1. Sign up for Digital Ocean
If you use the referal link below, you get $10 free (1 or 2 months) https://m.do.co/c/5424d440c63a

2. Create a droplet and log in via ssh
I will be using the root user, but would suggest creating a new user

3. Install Node/NPM
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -

sudo apt install nodejs

node --version
4. Clone your project from Github
There are a few ways to get your files on to the server, I would suggest using Git

git clone yourproject.git
5. Install dependencies and test app
cd yourproject
npm install
npm start (or whatever your start command)
# stop app
ctrl+C
6. Setup PM2 process manager to keep your app running
sudo npm i pm2 -g
pm2 start app (or whatever your file name)

# Other pm2 commands
pm2 show app
pm2 status
pm2 restart app
pm2 stop app
pm2 logs (Show log stream)
pm2 flush (Clear logs)

# To make sure app starts when reboot
pm2 startup ubuntu
You should now be able to access your app using your IP and port. Now we want to setup a firewall blocking that port and setup NGINX as a reverse proxy so we can access it directly using port 80 (http)
7. Setup ufw firewall
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow ssh (Port 22)
sudo ufw allow http (Port 80)
sudo ufw allow https (Port 443)
8. Install NGINX and configure
sudo apt install nginx

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
Add the following to the location part of the server block

    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000; #whatever port your app runs on
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
# Check NGINX config
sudo nginx -t

# Restart NGINX
sudo service nginx restart
You should now be able to visit your IP with no port (port 80) and see your app. Now let's add a domain
9. Add domain in Digital Ocean
In Digital Ocean, go to networking and add a domain

Add an A record for @ and for www to your droplet

Register and/or setup domain from registrar
I prefer Namecheap for domains. Please use this affiliate link if you are going to use them https://namecheap.pxf.io/c/1299552/386170/5618

Choose "Custom nameservers" and add these 3

ns1.digitalocean.com
ns2.digitalocean.com
ns3.digitalocean.com
It may take a bit to propogate

Add SSL with LetsEncrypt
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com

# Only valid for 90 days, test the renewal process with
certbot renew --dry-run

PROBLEM \\ i encountered a problem while trying to implement multiple user authentication strategies in passport.js.
It would only authenticate one user model which was the client in this case with myhousematter.com

SOLUTION \\ i found a blog post by Matthew Volk where he rewrote the passport.serializeUser and passport.deserializeUser 
functions which checked for the user model that were being authenticated and created a session with the user's unique ID
while storing the session object on the database and client side

PROBLEM \\ FInd and replace in vscode

SOLUTION \\ 
(mac) cmd + shift + h
(PC) ctrl + shift + h
expand replace
enter search term and replace term
confirm!

PROBLEM \\ Install free SSL from zeroSSL on hostinger

SOLUTION \\ 

Sign up on zeroSSL and follow the steps to create a new SSL certificate

Example #1:
Allow ZeroSSL certificates for site.com, including any subdomains as well as wildcards.

site.com. (CAA Record) CAA 0 issue "sectigo.com" 3600
site.com. (CAA Record) CAA 0 issuewild "sectigo.com" 3600


Example #2:
Allow ZeroSSL certificates for example.com, including any subdomains but not including wildcards.

site.com. (CAA Record) CAA 0 issue "sectigo.com" 3600
site.com. (CAA Record) CAA 0 issuewild ";" 3600


Example #3:
Allow ZeroSSL certificates for page.site.com only, not including the root domain, any subdomains as well as wildcards.

page.site.com. 3600 IN CAA 0 issue "sectigo.com"
site.com. (CAA Record) CAA 0 issuewild ";" 3600
site.com. (CAA Record) CAA 0 issue ";" 3600


https://caatest.co.uk/ (Test for validity ad availability of CAA records on domain)

If all goes through, download and install the SSL certificate generated on your domain

PROBLEM \\ couldnt ssh into my server through putty (struggled with it for dayyssss) but finally solved it :)

SOLUTION \\ The internet is just a miracle. Looked up a youtube video on the "putty fatal error: connection refused" and it
pointed me in the right direction i.e to check the status of my ssh service with "service ssh status" on my ubuntu droplet and it turned out it
was inactive because of a syntax error that i hadn't known about all along

Step 1 - On my Digital Ocean Ubuntu Droplet Recovery Console, i ran the following command "/usr/sbin/sshd -T" 
and it showed me the line where there was an error in my "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file and it turned out i had the character 
"e" at the beginning of the the first line of commented instructions. 

Step 2 - ran the command "nano etc/ssh/sshd_config" to open up the file with nano

Step 3 - Deleted The Character at the beginning of the commented code, saved the file and exited out of the file

Step 4 - ran the command "sudo service ssh restart" (No errors so it confirmed no syntax errors)

Step 5 - ran the command "service ssh status" to check the status of the ssh service 

Step 6 - LO AND BEHOLD, SSH BECAME ACTIVE!!!!!!!!! and i could ssh into my ubuntu server again through putty
